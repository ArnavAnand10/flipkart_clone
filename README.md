The user interface is crafted using Material-UI, providing a modern and responsive design with a rich set of UI components for a visually appealing experience.

4. React Redux for Efficient State Management
React Redux is employed for efficient state management, ensuring a smooth and predictable flow of data throughout the application.

5. React Router DOM for Navigation
Navigation within the application is facilitated by React Router DOM, enabling users to explore different sections effortlessly.

6. RESTful APIs
The backend, powered by Express.js, exposes RESTful APIs for seamless communication between the frontend and backend, handling data requests and updates.

7. Middleware Implementation
Middleware is used for various functionalities, enhancing the application's extensibility and maintaining a clean separation of concerns.

8. Bcrypt for Password Hashing
User passwords are securely stored using Bcrypt, adding an extra layer of protection to sensitive user data.
